- 👋 Hi, I’m Muhammad
- This is my Git Hub Page @MuhammadsGitHub
- 👀 I’m interested in to learn so many things that my life is not enough for it, So I should learn only the things those are most required for me for this world and for my life after death.
- Well, if you don not believe in the life after death, it is your decision. and we will all know the fact just after our death, but that will be too late to repent. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java, Oracle, Apex, SAP and much more 
- I am teaching SQL Server, Database Administration, Mail Server Administration, System Data Collaboration, MS Exchange Server, MS SharePoint Server, in Geroge Brown Collage, GeorgeBrown.ca 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Computer Vision 
- 📫 How to reach me: Muhammad . Shah @ George Brown ca (You know how to make a valid email address from this info) 
- 😄 Pronouns: He, His
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have to live, and I have to die. We have to live, and we have to die. God has given us this life and he will give us death and he will bring us into life again and then the real interesting part starts if we have done well and have pleased our God our creator, and the tragic part is if we do not do well and do mischiefs do bad things and do not follow our God then we have to suffer in the Hell, and even more tragic part is that we have to face the day of resurrection the day of judgement the Heaven the Hell the grave the life after death even we do not believe in it. Ah, I want to convey the message, may God / Allah (Arabic name) / our creator give me the ability to convey the message. 
Please do a favor to yourself. If you do not believe in these things please do not waist a single second and try to get knowledge of these things life is to short and we have the time until we die. Now a days everything and knowledge is available on the internet and we can research and we can sort out and distinguish the right knowledge from the rest of the knowledge and then we can make it the part of our beliefs, and then we can continue to live until Allah gives us the time but then we will live according to the rules those will make our this life a success full life and also will make our life after this a pleasant and successful life forever.
